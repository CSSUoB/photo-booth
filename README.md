# CSS photo booth

**NOTE**: this is fairly hacky code written by someone who had no idea how to
*use Gatsby. Therefore, it's a bit... crap.

## Development

Get the code:

    $ git clone ...

Install dependencies using yarn:

    $ yarn install

Run the development server:

    $ yarn develop

## Deployment

To deploy the photo booth, you can use the incredibly hacky scripts found in
`deploy/`. It contains setup scripts, server configs, etc, all you need to
get it running on a fresh install of Ubuntu.
