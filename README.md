# CSS photo booth

Code to be used for the photo booth at the CSS ball 2020.

**NOTE**: this is fairly hacky code written by someone who had no idea how to
*use Gatsby. Therefore, it's a bit... crap.

## Development

Get the code:

    $ git clone git@github.com:CSSUoB/photo-booth.git

Install dependencies using yarn:

    $ yarn install

Run the development server:

    $ yarn develop

## Deployment

To deploy the photo booth, you can use the incredibly hacky scripts found in
`deploy/`. It contains setup scripts, server configs, etc, all you need to
get it running on a fresh install of Ubuntu.
